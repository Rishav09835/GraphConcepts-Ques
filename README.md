# 📘 Graph Concepts and Questions

Welcome to my Graph Concepts and Questions repository! 👋

## 📌 About

This repo is a personal collection of **graph theory concepts** and **practice questions** that are essential for understanding graphs properly.

I'm currently learning graphs myself, and I created this repo to:
- 📖 Document key graph concepts in a clear and concise way
- 🧠 Practice important graph problems
- 🔁 Revisit and revise whenever needed

Whether you're just starting with graphs or want to brush up on your knowledge, this repo might be helpful!

## 📂 Contents
- Traversal techniques (BFS, DFS)
- Topological sorting (BFS, DFS)

## 🚧 Work in Progress
Currently paused!
I'm actively learning and updating this repo as I go. Feel free to explore, clone, or contribute!
